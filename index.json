Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Aaditya Ramdas and Alessandro Rinaldo. I recently graduated from the same department with a Ph.D. in Statistics.\nResearch My research interest lies in understanding the sequential and adaptive nature of data analysis. I study how commonly used statistical inference procedures behave under the presence of an analyst\u0026rsquo;s data-dependent choices. My current projects focus on designing and analyzing nonasymptotic sequential testings and online change-point detection procedures.\nDuring the Ph.D., my thesis\u0026rsquo;s focus was to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the selection bias caused by different sorts of human interventions in settings of adaptive experimentation like multi-armed bandits, advised by Aaditya Ramdas and Alessandro Rinaldo. I have also worked extensively with Larry Wasserman to understand the geometrical and topological structure of data-generating processes.\nKeywords: Anytime-valid inference, Sequential test, Multi-armed bandit, Change-point detection\nRecent Papers E-detectors: a nonparametric framework for online changepoint detection\nJ.
